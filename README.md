## App Descriptions

ExpedAnalysis application is an analytics-based information system that helps expedition services JNE, J&T, and SiCepat to understand customer reviews regarding central warehouses in each province. This application analyzes review data to identify shortcomings, provide insights into customer satisfaction, and offer suggestions to improve service quality across all operational regions.

## Background

The logistics industry in Indonesia continues to grow in line with the increasing demand for fast, reliable, and affordable shipping services. However, significant challenges remain, particularly regarding customer complaints that can impact business reputation and sustainability. Numerous negative reviews on platforms like Google Maps provide direct insights into the issues faced by shipping warehouses in various regions. With proper analysis, this review data can be used to identify and understand the root causes of these problems and offer relevant suggestions for companies.

## Objectives

- Developing a model using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to cluster Google Maps reviews into several groups. 
- Presenting the analysis results through visualizations (pie chart, word cloud) to provide insights into customer satisfaction, along with insight and suggestions for improving service quality across all operational areas.
